<h2> <u>About Me</u></h2>
		

		<p style="padding-right: 60px; padding-left: 60px;"> I am young business professional with a variety of experiences and looking to gather more. Through my work as a Student Manger for a two-time Championship team in the Wisconsin Badgers Menâ€™s Basketball Team (2020,2022), I have the knowledge of what it takes for a team to win. In my experience as a DoorDash driver, I understand the importance and processes of great customer service. As a lifeguard, I understand poise and responsibility. As a Ticket Sales and Service Intern with the Minnesota Twins, I understand the structure and function of a team behind a team, and what it takes to succeed in a business setting. </p>
